## Program Language
MATLAB

## Introduction
This project is about OFDM simulation and USRP-based offline experimental scripts. 
Change the global parameter 'sysMode' can make this program running in simulation mode or offline txdsp/rxdsp mode. 
This program is easy to read, modify, and add user-defined functions.

## About me
I am interested in optical fiber communications, including optical OFDM, long-haul coherent optical fiber transmission systems, optical access, short-range and data center interconnection transmissions. 
I have a great deal of experience in simulation of optical fiber communications using MATLAB and VPI transmissionMaker, offline experiment, and optical digital signal process chip design.
