## Program Language
MATLAB

## Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is about OFDM simulation and USRP-based offline experimental scripts.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change the global parameter 'sysMode' can make this program running in simulation mode or offline txdsp/rxdsp mode.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is easy to read, modify, and add user-defined functions.

## About me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am interested in optical fiber communications, including optical OFDM, long-haul coherent optical fiber transmission systems, optical access, short-range and data center interconnection transmissions.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a great deal of experience in simulation of optical fiber communications using MATLAB and VPI transmissionMaker, offline experiment, and optical digital signal process chip design.
